# Adversarial Machine Learning Defenses
Defenses against white-box evasion attacks

The code in this repository is based on an assignment for [CS 404/504](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/vakanski/CS_504.html).  
The code preprocesses:  
 - Preprocesses the LFW dataset
 - Trains a classifier on it
 - Generates white-box attacks against the classifier
 - Implements two different defenses against the attacks
   - Binary input detection
   - Adversarial training
 
The scripts are in the Jupyter notebook format. The advised way to run the scripts is with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Google Colab is an environment for running Jupyter notebooks on Google hardware. Free GPUs are available, and it is highly recommended you use one. It will save you days of time.  

The library used for the adversarial attacks and training is the [Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART)](https://adversarial-robustness-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
